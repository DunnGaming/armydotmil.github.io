# The Official Home Page of the United States Army - Styleguide


The styleguide is a collection of HTML, CSS, and JS snippets that are leveraged throughout the wwww.army.mil site. This library combines all the snippets currently use in production into a few downloadable files.

# Quick Start

1. Download the CSS [style.css](https://armydotmil.github.io/css/style.css) and JS [armydotmil.min.js](https://armydotmil.github.io/e2/js/rv7/armydotmil/armydotmil.min.js).
     
2. Copy the [style.css](https://armydotmil.github.io/css/style.css) and [armydotmil.min.js](https://armydotmil.github.io/e2/js/rv7/armydotmil/armydotmil.min.js) files to a location that is accessible by your respective project.  

    **NOTE: Do not hotlink the CSS and JS from github. These files can change at any moment.**

3. Link to the CSS and JS files in your html template to include the styles and functionality.  

    `<link rel="stylesheet" href="/path-to-file/style.css" type="text/css" media="screen">`  
    `<script src="/path-to-file/armydotmil.min.js" type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8"></script>`

4. Use the HTML from the [examples](https://github.com/armydotmil/armydotmil.github.io/tree/master/_includes/elements) in your html template.
